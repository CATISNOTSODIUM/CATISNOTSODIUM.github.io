## About me
I'm currently a first-year Computer Science student at National University of Singapore (NUS). I'm used to be a physics enjoyer, participating in the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO). However, my interest shifted towards software engineering, programming languages, and algorithms. You can read more from my blogs [here](blogs/index.md).

#### Interests
- Programming Language
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Software Development

## Work Experiences
- **Software Developer at Computing for
Voluntary Welfare Organisations (CVWO)** <br>
<small>May 2025 - Present | SQL, Bash, Go, React Native, Redux </small><br>
Migrated the Home Personal Care (HPC) module from Ruby on Rails to Go, and developed SQL scripts to transfer data from the original infrastructure to the new system for data exports. Developing a mobile app to facilitate consent requests from Next of Kin for Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH), integrated with the existing CVWO-AAC system.
- **Software Developer at Source Academy** <br>
<small>Jan 2025 - May 2025 | [Github](https://github.com/source-academy/js-slang/tree/master/src/tracer) </small><br>
A one-semester project-based course (CP3108A) to improve Source Academy, a platform for NUS programming introductory courses (CS1101S).
I worked on a team of reimplementing *stepper*, a step-by-step program execution visualisation tool, by sticking to the reduction logic in lambda calculus to ensure the correctness of the tool and improve the maintainability of the source code. <br>
You can try it out [here](https://sourceacademy.org/playground). Make sure that you select Source ยง1 or 2 and select the double arrow tab on the right to play with stepper.

- **Software Developer Intern at Lenor** <br>
<small>Sep 2024 - Dec 2024 | Express, Flask </small><br>
Developed and implemented an API management system for an essay grading platform. Trained generative adversarial network (GAN) model for strikethrough removal from student essays, improving the essay grading performance.
- **Part-time Full-stack Developer at Association of Thai Students in Singapore (ATSIS)** <br>
<small>Sep 2024 - Jun 2025 | Next JS </small><br>
Developed and maintained the official website for Thai students in Singapore. Developed an E-Card component for the ATSIS student membership system, enabling digital membership verification
and streamlined access to exclusive benefits.

- **Back-end developer intern at CMKL University** <br>
<small>May 2024 - Jun 2024 | Rust, Python </small><br>
Implemented a question-checker backend for Canarie, an AI assistant learning platform, utilizing the `axum-prisma-graphql` framework. Developed GraphQL APIs to validate user questions in RUST. Developed Robin, a Canarie CLI Database Management tool for administrators and teachers, serving as an abstraction layer between users and the backend database endpoint, simplifying database interactions.

## Personal Projects
- **BOF - An esoteric programming language (BF) with macros**<br>
<small>Typescript | [Github](https://bof-blush.vercel.app/) </small><br>
BOF is a BF interpreter with high level features such as variable declarations, assignments, macros and recursion. BOF uses recursive descent parsing with stack-based machine to interpret the program.
- **`lenor-strikethrough-identifier` - A strikethrough identification server for essay grading**<br>
<small>Flask | [Github](https://github.com/CATISNOTSODIUM/lenor-strikethrough-identifier) </small><br>
A backend for identifying strikethrough images by using generative adversarial network (GAN) model. This is a part of my Lenor internship.

### Mathematical Modeling
Mathematical modeling competition is a team competition that encourages students to come up with mathematical models to solve real-world problems under limited days (5 days for IMMC, 2 weeks for HiMCM). This is definitely one of my favourite types of competition. Props to all of my teammates for carrying the team!

- **The 2022 International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC) - Outstanding Award**<br>
<small> Task: Aboard! Boarding and Disembarking a Plane | [Our Solution](https://www.immchallenge.org/Contests/2022/papers/2022031.pdf) </small><br>
A finite automata model for evaluating the efficiency of various boarding and disembarking strategies 

- **The 2024 International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC) - Finalist Award**<br>
<small> Task: Picking the Perfect Pet </small><br>
A decision model (FAHP) for selecting the ideal pet based on factors such as household income and geographic location.

- **The 2023 High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM) - Finalist Award**<br>
<small> Task: Picking the Perfect Pet </small><br>
