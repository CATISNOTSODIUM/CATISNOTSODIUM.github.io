# CS1101S Teaching Experience

> The most beautiful program ever written, in my opinion, is the Eval/Apply Interpreter. <br/>
> **Gerald Jay Sussman**

I used to have an overarching love-hate relationship with this module solely due to the overemphasis on Programming-language related stuff which is not beginner friendly. However, this module perfectly serves as a starter pack for someone to dig dive to programming-language specialization which started to be one of my personal interests two-months after the course had ended. I felt like my job was to inspire people to think in the same way, and that's the reason I decided to apply for CS1101S TA.

The picture above summarizes what I had to teach for this course. CS1101S focuses a lot of stuff related to programming world. Language construct and problem solving, in my opinion, are the takeaway I want my students to achieve after this course. Understanding tricky programming-language concept itself a bonus.

Now, speaking of the teaching itself, the most important aspect that I have learned from teaching is to focus on simple examples, avoid generalization from the start, and provide sufficient intuition for students to work on. You can see the example from the solution slide [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JNJCNeBSkYScLcXqajoKD8WaZ812XoyK/view?usp=sharing) for the `subset` question.
