## CS2030S - Programming Methodology II 
Personally, the content of this module was well organized. The community (Ed discussion) was very active, and the lecturers were really great (preferably among the best I've taken in Y1). Programming exercises were a little bit challenging, but if you know what you are trying to do, it's not that bad. Even though it is not compulsory to complete all exercises in this semester, it's still a great exercise for students to familarize students with OOP and FP paradigms in one semester. Forcing students to use Vim was also one of the best decisions in my opinion. Although the getting used to it is very hard, It's really worth if you want to code faster.

However, the exams and PEs hindered me from enjoying this module. The exams (especially midterm) had a lot of typos, and the wrongly implemented min function in PE1 wrecked many students so bad, including me. Moreover, the infamous XOR question that aimed to test monad can posed unfair advantages for students who knew XOR before (either from CS2100 or other stuffs). Even though voiding these questions might seem unfair, I felt the lecturers should have taken more responsibility in setting them or at least conducted a thorough recheck of the exam.

## MA1522 - Linear Algebra for Computing
A very interesting introductory linear algebra module that covers wide range of topics, including concepts like eigenspaces and SVD decomposition. This is a hybrid module, where lecture contents were prerecorded and the actual f2f lecture slot served as a recitation session. Though the f2f lecture was not mandatory, it's a pretty great session for me to revise the content learnt throughout the videos. In addition, the lecturer spent some time going through exercises and optional challenges which were mostly proof-based. Even though this course does not require you to write any proofs (spoken by the lecturer himself), going through proofs really helped be consolidate my thoughts and make this course more fulfilling.

Speaking of the lecturer, he was very kind and dedicated to his teaching. Even though his teaching style was a little bit dry compared to previous iterations of this module, he's still great and very friendly. I also had some small talks with him before the session in later weeks. It's kinda sad that not many people did attend his lecture. I wish more people attended his lecture in the future.

Assessments
- A lot of lecture quiz (it gets kinda annoying at times)
- Three written assignments (The question style was similar to tutorial questions)
- Final Exam: Not that hard. The difficulty of the questions was similar to assignment questions.

Overall, this is a great module. It becomes abstract at times, but it remains manageable with decent effort.

## CS2100 Computer Organisation 
What an interesting roller coaster ride! This module is infamous for being one of the most annoying modules among trinity modules, and it actually is. Since all video contents were pre recorded, it’s recommended to stay ahead of the lecture a week or two, especially when you took it with CS2030s and CS2040s (in case you want to take trinity)

Now, let’s talk about the module itself. The content before the midterm was a whirlwind tour to number systems, C programming, and MIPS Processor. I really loved how the lecturer spent two weeks on MIPS since it’s very relevant to what we might encounter in the future. Moreover, these topics were pretty fascinating for me, and I actually enjoyed every bit (no pun intended) of them and I expected to keep this feeling until the end of this semester. Not until I opened some past year's midterm papers, I then realized that the difficulty of this module did not come from the content itself, but the awkwardness of how these concepts were tested. Luckily, this semester’s midterm paper is not that bad. The median was also really high this semester (26.5/40).

For the second half of the semester, we were introduced to boolean algebra, combinatorial circuits, MSI components, and Sequential circuits. Personally, I found this section to be a little dry due to its nature of the subject and I found these topics to be disconnected to what I’d learned during the first half. Though, the tutorial questions where you have to design the circuits (except sequential circuit) were really fun (kind of IQ test).

Here comes the last part of the module, and for me, one of the hardest topics: pipelining and cache. Not only do these topics have a lot of content to cover, but the lecturer only spent one week on each, and of course, it was during the last two weeks of the course.

Until this part, I had a neutral opinion on this module: the general content was not that bad, slightly annoying, but it’s doable. But you might have forgotten one thing, this is the Prof Aaron module. His exams were pretty infamous. Things started to get downhill when I attempted the PYP for final exams. I still remember myself sitting at CLB and starting to attempt the final PYP, and oh man, what on earth I had to deal with. The final exam was not only tedious to its core, but also consisted of tricky counting questions. Sometimes, I might have more chances of winning a lottery than precisely counting the number of cache hits and tracing pipelining clock cycles. I knew that there had been a lot of complaints regarding the exam design, but I didn’t expect it to be this bad. Luckily, I had some friends taking this module, making the grinding process more doable. After finishing the finals, my opinion on this module is downright negative. Personally, I found this year's paper slightly more difficult than PYP. I didn’t finish the paper on time.

There are a lot of things that could be improved in the next iterations of this module. I don’t think it’s a good idea to teach students MIPS a long while ago before reintroducing the concept at the end of the semester with pipelining. Other than that, the teaching quality is really great and I do not have any issues with it.
For the exam, considering the fact that this had been a point of complaint for a while and the lecturer hadn't attempted to resolve the issue, maybe it was actually difficult to create an exam that truly assesses student understanding in two hours. Maybe it's not a bad thing to leave the nature of the course as it is.

It’s for me one of the most memorable modules as a freshman :)
